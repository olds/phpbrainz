This is an OO PHP 5 library for accessing the musicbrainz API. To search the API, there are two different methods to access the musicbrainz API. One is a search based on criteria such as artist name, track name, release year, etc. The other is a retrieval of a specific musicbrainz record based on a specific identifier for the musicbrainz database (MBID). Typically you search for results using a release, track, or artist filter, then from those results retrieve the specific record you want with the detailed information. There are examples in the examples folder.
